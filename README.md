# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Sentinel: AI-Powered NIST Compliance Monitoring

Cyber Sentinel is an intelligent agent-based system that automates the detection of non-compliant log entries based on NIST cybersecurity standards and auto-creates Jira tickets for high-priority violations. It leverages SecureGPT and AWS Lambda to perform a multi-iteration analysis workflow.

## üß† Project Overview

### Agent 1: NIST Compliance Monitoring (SecureGPT Integration)
- **Triggered by**: S3 object upload (logs)
- **Runs**: Three iterations (basic analysis ‚Üí reflection ‚Üí final validation)
- **Uses**: SecureGPT API to classify logs as compliant or non-compliant across NIST categories
- **Saves**: Results to `nistanomolies` S3 bucket under different folders per iteration

### Agent 2: Jira Ticketing Automation
- **Triggered by**: S3 uploads to `results/` folder
- **Parses**: Markdown tables of violations
- **Creates**: Jira tickets based on violation severity
