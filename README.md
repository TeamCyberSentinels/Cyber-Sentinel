# Intelligent AI Agent for Real-Time NIST Cybersecurity Compliance Monitoring  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing an **AI-driven intelligent agent** capable of **real-time log monitoring** to assess compliance with **NIST cybersecurity standards**. The system will automatically detect security violations, open service tickets, and log events into a database for tracking and reporting.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Real-Time Log Monitoring**: Continuously scans system logs for security events.  
- **AI-Powered Compliance Detection**: Identifies non-compliant activities based on NIST guidelines.  
- **Automated Ticketing System**: Opens service tickets when violations are detected.  
- **Comprehensive Logging & Reporting**: Stores all compliance-related events in a structured database.
